Description: This package makes accessible thousands of observations, summaries, and model estimates of pediatric drug effect signals. 
    The database was created by Nicholas during his PhD thesis which you can read here (https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-5d9b-6738). 
    The observations are from the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. 
    Drug effect estimates were estimated across child development stages for the occurrence of an adverse event when exposed to a drug compared to other drugs.
    See the methods detailed in Chapter 3 of the thesis.
