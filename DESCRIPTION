Description: Caches and connects to a sqlite database containing half a million pediatric drug safety signals. 
    The database was created by Nicholas Giangreco during his PhD thesis which you can read here <https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-5d9b-6738>. 
    The observations are from the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. Generalized additive models estimated
    drug effects across child development stages for the occurrence of an adverse event when exposed to a drug compared to other drugs.
