# Introduction

This vignette quantifies the most likely ADEs to occur at development stages using our dGAM statistics. Our method quantifies the safety signal (after select covariate-adjustment) for every ADE at development stages _independently_. This vignette shows how to estimate the most likely ADE at each stage given that ADEs occur at multiple stages during childood. 

- Count the number of ADEs at each child develpment stage

- Visualize the distribution of safety signals at each child development stage

- Count the number of development stages that ADEs occur at

- Quantify the most probable ADE at develpment stages given occurrence and signal at other stages
